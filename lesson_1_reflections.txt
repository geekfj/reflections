How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    We know the difference between two different files in a timeline and probably the change may introduce a new bug. So checking the differences between the two files is very helpful.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    It is very convenient to do that and as a programmer we may be free to check it, change it and log it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Pros: logically save different versions; with no waste data
    Cons: has risks not uploading changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because many files are inter-connected.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    Use git log to know how many changes we have made and use git diff to compare two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    If I break something I can fix it later with the help of git checkout.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To track the project I am doing and collaborating with others.
