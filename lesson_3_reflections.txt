When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- when I cooperate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- many people submit changes and I do not want every change on my local and I manually control this operation.
